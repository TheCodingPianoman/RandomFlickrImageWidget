# Random Flickr Image Widget
A widget for [Scriptable](https://scriptable.app) that chooses a random image from a random album out of the configured user's albums on flickr.

In order to use this widget, you will need a flickr API key!
If you do not have a key yet, get a free one at flickr's [App Garden](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/).
